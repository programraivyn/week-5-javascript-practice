  <h1>Templates</h1>

  <p>
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals">Read more about
      templates here.</a>
  </p>

  <p>We know about variables. We know about Strings. We will now learn about But how to we put them together?</p>
  <p> We use backticks and ${ }. Have a look at an example</p>

  <h2>Example 1</h2>
  <p>Lets look at some variables and write them out in a string.</p>
  <p>
    <script>
      let playerName;
      playerName = "John";
      document.write(`Hi, ${playerName}. Welcome to the game!`)
    </script>
  </p>
  <p>
    <script>
      let dinnerItem;
      dinnerItem = "Lasagna";
      document.write(`We are having ${dinnerItem}, tonight!`)
    </script>
  </p>
  <p>
    <script>
      let fruit;
      fruit = "strawberry";
      document.write(`It's ${fruit} season.`)
    </script>
  </p>

  <h2>Example 2</h2>
  <p>You can have as many variables as you want. You can even use numbers!</p>
  <p>
    <script>
      let a;
      let b;
      let c;

      a = 12;
      b = 3;
      c = a + b;
      document.write(`${a} plus ${b} is equal to ${c}.`)
    </script>
  </p>
  <p>
    <script>
      c = a * b;
      document.write(`${a} times ${b} is equal to ${c}`);
    </script>
  </p>

  <p>
    <script>
      a = 512;
      b = 64;
      c = a / b;
      document.write(`${a} divided by ${b} is equal to ${c}`);
    </script>
  </p>

  <h2>Try it!</h2>
  <p>Now you try it!</p>
  <p>Make at least 5 more examples of templates yourself.</p>
<p>
  <script>
    let r;
    let s;
    let t;

    r = 29
    s = 61
    t = r + s;
    document.write(`&bullet; ${r} plus ${s} is equal to ${t}`)
  </script>
</p>
<p>
  <script>
    let person1;
    let person2;
    person1 = "Robert";
    person2 = "and friends";
    document.write(`&bullet; Hi, ${person1} ${person2}. Come along with me into the chaos of <em>coding</em>!`)
  </script>
</p>
<p>
  <script>
    let sport1;
    let sport2;
    let sport3;
    let sport4;
    sport1 = "basketball";
    sport2 = "football";
    sport3 = "soccer";
    sport4 = "baseball";
    document.write(`&bullet; Have you ever considered whether ${sport2} is more preferred than ${sport1}?
    Or if ${sport3} is more watched than ${sport4}?`)
  </script>
</p>
<p>
<script>
  a = 777;
  b = 21;
  c = 4;
  d = a / b * c;
  document.write(`&bullet; ${a} divided by ${b} multiplied by ${c} is equal to ${d}`);
</script>
</p>
<p>
  <script>
    let snackI;
    let snackII;
    let fruitI;
    let fruitII;
    let drinkI
    let drinkII;
    snackI = "pretzels";
    snackII = "yogurt";
    fruitI = "grapefruit";
    fruitII = "watermelon";
    drinkI = "water"; 
    drinkII = "tea";
    document.write(`&bullet; I really wish that ${fruitII} season would come sooner, although it's right around
    the corner now. I'll settle for my ${fruitI} in the meantime.<br> While I don't satisfy my cravings 
    often, ${snackI} and ${snackII} are easily my go-to munchies. Otherwise, I just ${drinkI} and ${drinkII}
    myself to <strong>constant</strong> bathroom runs!`)
